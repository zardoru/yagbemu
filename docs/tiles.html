<FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times"><FONT COLOR="#800080">First thing to
note about Gameboy tiles are their size. In most cases they are 8x8 squares
which are easily created using your favorite tile editor. These usually
throw out the code (in Hex or Decimal) for the tile which can then be pasted
into your code. You don't have to know their format to use them, but if
your interested read on.</FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times"><FONT COLOR="#800080">Makes bugger all
difference which you use, as long as you understand binary and how to convert
numbers between the two. Use which you prefer, just remember to add 0x
to the Hex, eg: 0x3C</FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times"><FONT COLOR="#800080">That's what the
tile format is using, and it uses two per line. If you don't know what
a flag is read the 'what's a flag' bit below. This means the first line
of a tile is represented by a pair of numbers like 11,22 and since tiles
have 8 lines you will have a structure with 16 numbers. The first number
of the pair represents the colours white (0) and light grey (1), the second
number shows white (0) and dark grey (1). When a pixel is both light and
dark grey it becomes black.</FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times"><FONT COLOR="#800080">A flag is part
of a binary number. Each bit of the number is a flag, so the binary number
0101 has four flags. 0101 equals 5 in Decimal. If you set the 4th flag
(remember to read binary numbers from right to left) the binary number
becomes 1101 (13 decimal). So by using 8 flags (a binary number like 01010101)
you can represent which pixels are 'on' for an entire line in a Gameboy
tile by using one number (in this case 85). But since you can only represent
2 'colours' using binary, and the Gameboy uses 4 (discounting the misspelt
Gameboy 'Color') you need to use a pair of binary flags, hence 2 numbers
to hold the colours of each line. This is shown below.</FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times"><FONT COLOR="#800080"></FONT></FONT>
